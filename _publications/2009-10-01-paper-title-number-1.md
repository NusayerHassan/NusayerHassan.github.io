title: "Balanced Coverage in Fault-Tolerant Broadcasting for Wireless Multi-hop Networks"

excerpt: 'This paper proposed two algorithms "K-cover” and “K Set Cover” algorithm to find disjoint sets from one-hop neighbors of a Wireless Multi-hop Network to cover two-hop neighbors K times. Through a Java implementation followed by NS2
simulation, it provided different performance mertics againt two algorithms.
