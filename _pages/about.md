I'm S M Nusayer Hassan, a data analyst working on mobile sensing and health at the Sensing Systems for Health Lab, University of Virginia, under the guidance of Professor Laura Barnes. With a Master's in Systems Engineering from UVA and prior experience as a Graduate Research Assistant, I've honed my skills in leveraging technology to address healthcare challenges. I also worked as a System Engineer at the Ed Egelman Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Edward H. Egelman. I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. Additionally, I've served as a Senior Product Specialist at Reve Systems. Committed to driving innovation and making impactful contributions, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of knowledge in both the data analytics and systems engineering fields.
