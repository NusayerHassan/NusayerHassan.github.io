Welcome to my Homepage!

I am Soneya Binta Hossain. I am a first-year gradute student at the University of Virginia. I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ( [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) ). After my bachelor's, I joined [REVE Systems's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems) research and development team and did many challenging and interesting projects there. I started studying master's in Compter Science at UVa in August 2019 and I eventually will be getting my Ph.D. here. My research interests are Software Engineering, Software Security, Machine Learning and the intersection of these fields.
