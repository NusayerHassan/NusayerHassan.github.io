**Bio**
--------------------
I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, started in August 2019. I am working in the Verifiable Computing and Robotics (VCR) Lab under the supervision of [Professor Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/). I have completed my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ( [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) ). Before entering grad school I worked 
at [REVE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems) for three years from March 2016 to May 2019 as a software engineer in the research and development (R&D) team.
