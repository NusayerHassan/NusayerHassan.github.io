Hi!

I am soneya, a CS gradute student at the University of Virginia. I completed my undergraduate in computer science and engineering from Bangledesh University of Engineering and Techonology ( [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) ). After my bachelor, I joined [REVE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems) as a Java programmer in the Switch and Billing team and did many challenging and interesting projects there. I started my Ph.D in CS at UVa from Aug, 2019 and my research interest is Software Engineering, Software Security, Machine Learning or at the intersection of these fields.
