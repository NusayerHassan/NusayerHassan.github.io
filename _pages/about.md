# S M Nusayer Hassan  

<br><br>

I am Nusayer Hassan, a master's student in Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia, starting from Spring'21. I am interested in Systems and Networking, and data analysis.  
I was born in Bangladesh. I received a bachelor of science in computer science and engineering (CSE) from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh, in 2011. After my bachelor's, I worked at [REVE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems), a multinational VoIP company, for nine years as a system engineer.  I love to travel, play soccer and table tennis.
