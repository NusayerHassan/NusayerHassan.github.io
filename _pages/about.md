I am a gradute student in the Computer Science department at the University of Virginia. Currently, I am working in the Verifiable Computing and Robotics (VCR) Lab under the supervision of [Professor Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/). I have completed my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ( [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) ). After my bachelor's, I joined [REVE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems) as a software engineer in the research and development team. I started my Ph.D. in  CS at the University of Virginia from August, 2019 and my research interests are automated validation and verification of software systems with machine learing techinques.
