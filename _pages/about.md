Hi!

I am soneya, a CS gradute student at the University of Virginia. I completed my undergraduate in computer science and engineering from Bangledesh University of Engineering and Techonology ( BUET ). After my bachelor, I joined [REVE Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REVE_Systems) as a software engineer in the Switch and Billing team as a Java programmer and did many challenging and interesting projects there. I started my Ph.D in CS at the Uva from Aug,2019 and my research interest is Software Engineering, Software Security, Machine Learning or at the intersection of these fields.
